License Note

This license is based on the open source zlib/libpng license. The idea was to 
keep the license as simple as possible to encourage use of NUnit in free and 
commercial applications and libraries, but to keep the source code together and 
to give credit to the NUnit contributors for their efforts. While this license 
allows shipping NUnit in source and binary form, if shipping a NUnit variant is 
the sole purpose of your product, please let us know.
